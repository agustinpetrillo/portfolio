    "description": "This was my first Landing Page project and my first job as a Front-End developer. It was mainly developed using the Nuxt framework, using Vue. Several libraries were employed, such as TailwindCSS (HTML based style) and AOS so as to make the website more dynamic and attractive to the user. I decided to move this web app to Next since I am currently in the processing of learning the intricacies of this framework, and also in case a client wishes to make improvements on this foundation or to add future libraries or functionality. It also includes a completely functional form where you can directly contact the company to hire its services or ask anything you'd like.",
