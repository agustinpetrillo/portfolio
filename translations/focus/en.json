  "description": "This was my first Landing Page project and my first job as a Front-End developer. It was mainly developed using the Nuxt framework, using Vue. Several libraries were employed, such as TailwindCSS (HTML based style) and AOS (animation on scroll). I decided to move this web app to Next since I am currently in the processing of learning the intricacies of this framework. It also includes a completely functional form where you can directly contact the company to hire its services or ask anything you'd like.",
