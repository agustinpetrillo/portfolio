    "description": "This website was developed using Next, the framework with which I currently work. It is the result of my experience and learning process, which allowed me to speed up the developing process and to optimize its functionality and code. The project involves logic based systems, such as JavaScript, and libraries such as TailwindCSS. It's a simple and functional portfolio that constitutes a reflection of my current skills and knowledge, including my contact links (social network and a form-based contact on the website itself). Includes an automatic translation system from Spanish into English and vice versa (as an extra option for the user) which also detects the default language associated with the browser used. It also includes a section that shows all my projects (both code-based and hosting). Changes and improvements, both in form and content, will appear as I develop my skills, so please check it out every once in a while!.",
