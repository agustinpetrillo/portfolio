  "description": "This website was developed with Next, the framework with which I currently work. It's a Landing Page project, that shows the several services of a company. It includes a completely functional form for direct contact with the company, and it also includes a calendar to be able to book a date for the hiring of services. The design is user-friendly, simple and minimalistic, with a unique background in each section, creating a parallax effect. The background with the main content of the page is asynchronous, which makes for a fun effect. This was achieve through the use of JavaScript and a background image with a high height. As is customary, I employed the TailwindCSS library and AOS.",
